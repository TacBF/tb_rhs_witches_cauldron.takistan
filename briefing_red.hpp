<titleFont>Deployment Options:</font><br />
<*> You can get to the AO either by spawning at F.B. Whiskey or by going from the main base by car, air or armor.<br<br />


<titleFont>Attack Strategies:</font><br />
<*> Establish FO's quickly.<br />
<*> Keep your eyes open for enemy Forward Outposts. Without them the enemy forces won't come far!<br />

<titleFont>Defence Strategies:</font><br />
<*> Use your MWS and construction supplies to fortify the objectives!<br />
<*> It is recommended to use helicopters for getting supplies e.g. ammo, light vehicles, construction materials to the first few objectives as it will take a long time to get there by ground vehicles!<br />
<*> Try to defend Village as long as possible! If your team loses the village, it will also lose access to F.B. Whiskey!<br />
